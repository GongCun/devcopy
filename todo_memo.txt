# TODO
* Create database with dbx, design the data structure.
* Draw the k-ary tree (include description), highlight the current node.
* Find the path from current versiont to the target version, rollback or
  update thru the path.
- Wrap the functions to library.
- Re-write the devcopy, save the backward files (undo), managed by the
  version control. The versioned files saved in a directory named by
  the version-hash-code:

      version-code -- chg.files, undo.files, hash.files (necessary?), rollback
      depends on the chg/undo files.

  Attention: devcopy equal to create a new branch.

- Show the copy progress of each process.

  Parent process get the process by reading the shared memory.
